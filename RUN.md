## How to run the project
1. Make sure you are using Windows and your computer has rust and cargo installed (for MacOS, there are dependencies that doesn't work for unknown reasons).
2. Select a place where you want to clone the project and execute `git clone https://github.com/cty012/CS128h/new/main`.
4. In the project root folder, execute `cargo run`
5. If a window pops up then you may enjoy the game. If not (or if it appears for an instant and disappears) check if your computer supports vulkan/metal (I do not have a lot of computers to test this, but I assume all Windows systems support vulkan and all MacOS systems support metal).
